Let’s fix it!</p><p>It seemed to me like the solution was standardisation, either everyone writes their titles so that they are readable when the text in the tab bar is left-aligned or everyone writes them so that they are readable right-aligned.</p><p>After some thoughts I came to the conclusion that it was preferable that all text inside of tab bars be written such that is was readable when the text was right-aligned (like for the PostgreSQL website) because it allows the text to be written in a coherent hierarchy: from general to more specific (like is used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">dates</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">paths</a>, and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/modules.html#module-source-filenames">paths</a>) and because the (only?) reason some websites have the more specific information at the start of their title is so that it is visible when the right side of the title is truncated.</p><p>We still have a problem.</p><p>It isn’t practical to go against the web’s (4.88 billion users) unstoppable momentum: the standardisation dream would involve having to convince everyone to rewrite their website titles such that they are readable right-aligned and convince browser vendors to display titles differently, something that is just simply impossible and even if it was possible, it wouldn’t necessarily be beneficial.</p><p>A second solution would be to have a per site configuration: either allow websites to indicate how they wish their title to be displayed or have an external database that is loaded on the client side using a browser extension or by the browser itself.</p><p>Neither solutions seem within reach, the first would require extending some kind of web standard, the second requires convincing browser vendors (and effectively extending the web standard) to make some changes as there are currently no APIs to change text direction from an extension.</p><h3 id="panacea">Panacea</h3><p>Except we don’t need to. Everything mentioned so far assumes that there is currently no way to change the alignment of text in tab bars, but in fact there is, and I’ve hinted at it by referring to “text direction”, because the solution is that:</p><p><img src="/assets/files/title-direction/arabic_news.png" alt="The tab with Arabic text is right aligned and truncated towards the left"/></p><p>Websites that use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left_script">right-to-left scripts</a> (like Arabic and Hebrew), have the text within title bar right-aligned.</p><p>And so this leads us to our solution:</p><div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span><span class="ni">&amp;rlm;</span>Nils's website - The ultimate solution to the nightmare of truncated tab titles<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>

For example it can make someone believe the default is not what it is, or the operator precedence is not in the order it actually is and as a result, the implicit option is preferable in some if not most of these cases.</p><p>Additionally, the implicit option also saves time when developing.</p><p>If for some reason, the implicit way is not clear enough, documentation (mainly through comments) I believe is a better solution than bearing this implied intent and in the case of forward compatibility, often the new default is what you want; if not, upgrading is usually trivial.</p><p>To conclude, in software development clarity is something that we want to maximise, and I believe that more often than people think doing things implicitly is the way to go about that.</p><p>Although this post was written in the context of software development the implied intent of being explicit also applies to different areas of life.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;programming&quot;]"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Software development (as well as many things in life) is all about making choices, one of them is deciding whether to do things in an implicit or explicit way.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">TrollCAT CTF 2021 write-ups</title><link href="/ctf/writeup/2021/02/06/trollcat21.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="TrollCAT CTF 2021 write-ups"/><published>2021-02-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/ctf/writeup/2021/02/06/trollcat21</id><content type="html" xml:base="/ctf/writeup/2021/02/06/trollcat21.html"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend, my team, <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/120438">Pwnzorz</a>, and I played in TrollCAT CTF 2021 and came in second placed.

One thing that I noticed was that the neighbour “<strong><em>Rocked</em></strong>” the password, which is a reference to the rockyou wordlist. So I ran the same command as I did for FREE WIFI however the password was not found which meant that despite what I had inferred from the description, the password was not contained within the rockyou wordlist. I thought about applying rules, to the aforementioned list, however, considering how long it had taken to crack the password for FREE WIFI (about 5 minutes), I thought that adding on rules to the list would make the number of possible passwords too large and it would infeasible to crack it.</p><p>I moved on to another challenge as I didn’t know how to proceed.</p><p>After some time, I went back to the challenge and noticed something in the description, it mentioned that the “neighbour knew about our CTF”, insinuating that the password was changed in accordance to it. This suggested they had set their Wi-Fi password to the full flag (with the flag format). So I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sed</code> to add the flag format to each password in the rockyou wordlist.</p><div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sed -e 's/^/TROLLCAT{/' -e 's/$/}/' ~/rockyou.txt &gt; rockyou_troll.txt
</code></pre></div></div><p>Because the flag format was all in upper case letters (in the challenge description), I thought that it was likely that the password didn’t contain any lower case letters and used grep to shrink the wordlist and crack the password:</p><pre>
$ grep -v [[:lower:]] rockyou_troll.txt &gt; rockyou_troll_upper.txt
$ aircrack-ng -w rockyou_troll_upper.txt hack2.cap-01.cap

</code></pre></div></div><p>The function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gen_hashes_and_prices</code> generates a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secret</code> using the function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">urandom()</code> from the module <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">os</code>. I assumed this function to generate cryptographically random numbers (we can’t guess the numbers it will generate from previous numbers it generated) as I know <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/urandom</code> to be secure, and in fact <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.urandom">the documentation</a> for it confirms this is the case. It then sets the seed used by the python <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">random</code> module, which means that if we know the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secret</code> we can possibly get all the numbers generated, additionally the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">random</code> module isn’t cryptographically secure which means that with enough numbers generated by it, we can guess the next numbers.</p><p>The function then iterates over the days in the week from Monday to Saturday (excluding Sunday), and for each iterates over the times “am” and “pm”. For each times (combination of day and time), it generates a price using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gen_price</code> function and then appends to the list <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hashes</code>, the value returned by the function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hash</code>, with as input a string made-up of the secret and the day of the week, time and price. If the price generated is the highest seen so far, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">highest</code> is updated.</p><p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gen_price</code> function generates a price based on 2 calls to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">randint</code>. This means that knowing the price of Monday at time “am”, means that we have one of the number generated and an estimation of another one. Because the seed used by the random function is updated each “week”, it means that each “week” is independent and we can’t use data from previous weeks to solve the following weeks.</p><p>I searched online to find how to predict numbers from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">random</code> module. I found <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/53811/is-it-possible-to-recover-the-seed-used-by-pythons-pseudo-random-number-generat">a post</a> the discusses it. However, the answers says that even with 40 generated numbers it is not possible to reverse the state of the number generator. Considering that for each week, only 24 numbers (2 per generated price, for 2 times for 6 days per week) are generated, it means that exploiting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">random</code> module seems out of reach.</p><p>Next I looked at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hash</code> function. It starts with an initial state and then for each group of 16 bytes in the data, changes the state based on it.</p><p>At this point I was lost and didn’t know what to do. A teammate, Uzay, who was also looking at the challenge said that he managed to run it locally, and that it allowed to print some stuff. I followed his suggestion and added a print statement that prints the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">state</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hash</code> function for each block of 16 bytes:</p><div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">group</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">pad</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">))</span>

This is because the data is processed in blocks of 16 bytes, and the first 16 bytes are the secret which is the same for each day of the week. (Also note that in the output, every other line is just the inital state). This means that if we were able to determine the state after the first block was processed, we could brute force the different possible prices and find the one that matched the hash we get from the server, by manually performing the processing of the second block. My initial thought was that maybe we could use some kind of “simultaneously” equation to determine that state and decided to look at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hash</code> function, to see whether that was possible.</p><div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">pad</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">):</span>

The only part that isn’t reversible is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repeated_xor</code> operation which just XORs together its 2 parameters, the roundkey (i.e. a 16 bytes block of input data), and the current state. This meant that in order to reverse it, we needed the input data which was already what we were trying to get. This is when I realised we were given the price on Monday at the “am” time, which meant that we could actually reverse the hash function until we reached the common state shared by all the hashes (i.e. the state when the hash function has only processed the secret).</p><p>So I started to write a script to do this.</p><div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">#!/usr/bin/env python3

This allows us to retrieve the state that is common to all hashes. Then in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find_highest</code> function, I go through each time in each day (combination of day of week and “am” or “pm”), and find by brute forcing which price is correct and get the highest correct value.

</code></pre></div></div><p>When I opened the binary inside of ghidra I couldn’t really make sense of what was going because go uses different calling conventions then those used by C and C++. I searched online for go calling conventions and found <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-calling-convention-x86-64.html">an article</a> that explained them. Because of this I ditched ghidra for r2. Because arguments are passed on the stack in go, you have the disable variable analysis in radare2: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e anal.vars = false</code>. By reverse engineering I was able to understand that a mapping between characters was created (with a hashmap), in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.createMappingTable</code> function and that in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.apply</code> function, the mapping was applied to the password given and it was then base64 encoded. Once those modifications had been done the password was compared to the string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eHpzdG9yc1hXQXtpYl80cjFuMmgxNDY1bl80MXloMF82Ml95MDQ0MHJfNGQxbl9iNXVyMn0=</code> which after base64 decoding gave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xzstorsXWA{ib_4r1n2h1465n_41yh0_62_y0440r_4d1n_b5ur2}</code>. I now had to reverse engineer the mapping to understand how it worked and recover the flag. The way I did it, is by sending a string containing all possible characters and then using gdb see what they were getting transformed to. Using this information I was able to make a script to decrypt the flag:</p><div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">#!/usr/bin/env python3

Use it during your investigation.</p><p>We are counting on you.</p><p><a href="/assets/files/castorsCTF20/flag.png"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flag.png</code></a><a href="/assets/files/castorsCTF20/ransom"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ransom</code></a><a href="/assets/files/castorsCTF20/traffic.pcapng"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">traffic.pcapng</code></a></p><h5 id="solution-6">Solution</h5><p>This was another go binary to reverse engineer. From the files we were given, it was already possible to guess that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binary</code> had encrypted a file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flag.png</code> and we now had the encrypted version of it. The pcap would probably contain a key that was sent over the network and that would allow decryption. Looking at the disassembly in confirmed this. The binary gets seeds from a server and then sends back one of the seed which I assume was the actual seed used (I didn’t actually reverse engineer this part, to save time, as the worth case scenario of that assumption was me have to do work I should have done anyway). The binary then sets the seed used using <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/#Seed"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rand.Seed</code></a>. The function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.encrypt</code> is then called. It opens the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flag.png</code>, and then xors each of the bytes with a random value from <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/#Intn"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rand.Intn(254)</code></a>.</p><p>Because in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pcapng</code>, the seed sent to the server was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1337</code>, I wrote a little go script that generated 1500 numbers with that seed, and then a python script that xored the content of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flag.png</code> with those numbers:</p><div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>POST /seed HTTP/1.1

The idea is to have the “hare” and “tortoise” process open different files. The “hare” process would open a very large file which will take time to be read, allowing the “tortoise” process to have the time to read <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flag.txt</code>.</p><p>The solution I took is based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g137gsB9Wk">a video</a> from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w">liveoverflow</a>, which I had watched earlier this year.</p><p>I compiled the following code:</p><div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">#define _GNU_SOURCE
